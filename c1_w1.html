            Some lists use Circles and Bullets. These are UL lists. 
            (Unordered Lists). Each UL contains li tags or List Items.<br>

            Types of Martial Arts:
            <ul>
                <li>Karate</li>
                <li>Kendo</li>
                <li>Judo</li>
            </ul>

            If you want a list with numbers or letter, it would be an OL
            (ordered list).

            <ol>

            We mentioned how you can put a variety of types of elements inside of an li tag,
letting you put images, links, or nested lists inside of a list.
We call putting these elements together, composing them.
Composition is an important concept in computer science, and
is common in design of languages, whether they're markup languages, like HTML, or
programming languages Images like Java.
This property lets you build large, complex systems, whether web pages or
programs, in a way that you can understand.
You can put small, easy to understand pieces together to build larger,
more complex things.
In the case of web pages,
we can put elements together to get more sophisticated formatting.
In most cases, you can compose elements with each other however you want,
although there are some rules.
For example, you cannot put the title tag inside of an unordered list
because it does not make sense for title of the page to be inside the list.
The title tag can only go in the header. 
        </p>
        <p>
            However, you can make a list of images or a list of list.
When you make a list of list.
It is called a nested list.
Nesting is another concept in computer science.
Which just refers to one of a thing being inside of another of that thing.
Here you are going to learn about nested lists.
Later when we delve into programming you will learn about nested loops.
The concept is the same a loop inside of a loop, much like a list inside of a list.
You can make a nested list such as this one by placing a ul tag which describes
the inner list inside of the li tag for one of the items in the outer list.
Notice how the bullets for the inner list are different from the bullets for
the outer list.
As well as how the inner list is indented more deeply.
These features both help whoever's reading.
The web page visually distinguished the content in the outer and inner lists.
As well as, when you write the HTML, it is helpful to indent
more deeply each time you put one element inside of another.

            An example of a nested list, states and capitols:
            <ul>
                <li>Arizona</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Phoenix</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Nebraska</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lincoln</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Texas</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Austin</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Another way you might want to organize information in your HTML is with a table.
Which let's you arrange things into rows and columns.
For example you might want to display some information about
food based on what tastes you associate with it.<br>
            "table" creates a table, "th" table header, "tr" table row, and "td" table cells.
        </p>
        <p>
            <table>
                <th>One</th><th>Two</th><th>Three</th>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>3</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>4</td>
                    <td>6</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </p>
    </body>
